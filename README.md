### Enlivening the Data
The first display will be a chart showing the frequency of crimes in Boulder since the start of the new year. We will have different types of charts as well, such as a chart displaying crimes for certain days. Finally, there will be a map showing the location of crimes. By displaying both the bar chart and the map, as well as allowing users to interact by looking at certian crimes, users will get a good grasp on the crime situation of the city.

### D3 feature utilization
Most of the charts will be bar charts, with the user having the option to select what type of data to view on the chart.
The crime map will be a chloropleth, which will also include user-interactive filters.
